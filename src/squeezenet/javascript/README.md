# SqueezeNet

## JavaScript Implementation

### Prerequisites

In order to run the JavaScript implementation of SqueezeNet, one needs
to have the following installed locally:
* [Node]()
* [Yarn]()
* [TypeScript]()
* [Browserify]()

Once these are installed, you can build the code:

``
yarn && yarn build
``

This will build the TypeScript files into a standalone inside of the ```./dist``` directory.

All that is left to do afterwards run:

``
yarn run
``

This will generate an accessible server at ``Localhost://1337`` which you can then navigate to in order to run the code.
